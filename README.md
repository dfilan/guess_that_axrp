# Guess that AXRP

A guessing game: the game randomly picks an AXRP episode, randomly picks a sentence in that episode, presents the user with the sentence, and the user has to guess what episode it's from.

They can do this multiple times, and optimally submit to a leaderboard.

Things that still need to be done:
  - Auto-update the DB
  - Show URL of episode
  - That type of field where the user types a search term in a box to go down a list
  - Run on Render
  - Test I've correctly started the episode db
  - Button to reset session
  - Get right answer not stored in user cookies
  - Reset session when you submit your score (so you can't submit multiple times)
  - Only include sentences of at least 5 words
